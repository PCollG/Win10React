# README for Personal Windows 10 Styled Web Project with Storybook and NextJS

## Project Overview

Welcome to my personal project: a Windows 10 Styled Web Application! This project is a creative endeavor to build a web application that mimics the aesthetics and functionality of the Windows 10 operating system. Developed using NextJS, this project showcases a unique blend of modern web technologies and classic interface design.

## Development Status

**Current Phase: Active Development**

As this is a personal project, it's currently in the active development stage. The application is evolving, with new features and improvements being added regularly.

## Key Features (Under Development)

- **Windows 10 Style Interface**: Aiming to replicate the look and feel of Windows 10, including elements like the taskbar, start menu, and window design.
- **Interactive UI Components**: Developing various interactive components styled after Windows 10, ensuring a familiar and engaging user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Focused on creating a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

## Storybook Integration

This project includes an integrated Storybook, which serves as a visual guide and documentation for all the custom components. Storybook is an essential tool in this project for testing and showcasing component designs independently from the main application.

### Storybook Features

- **Component Isolation**: Facilitates development and debugging by isolating each component.
- **Live Previews**: Offers real-time interaction with components, reflecting the latest design changes.
- **Documentation**: Provides detailed documentation on component usage, properties, and design guidelines.

## Technology Stack

- **NextJS**: Leveraging the power of NextJS for server-side rendering and static site generation for React-based web applications.
- **React**: Utilizing React for building dynamic and reusable UI components.
- **CSS**: Styling is meticulously crafted with CSS to achieve the distinctive Windows 10 look and feel.
